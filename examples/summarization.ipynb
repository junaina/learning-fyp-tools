And we will continue to work with our creative industries to help seize the exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world.\"\\nIt is currently conducting a review of the creative industries.\\nUkie said this week it wanted to work with the government to \"shape a favourable post-EU landscape for our world-leading games and interactive entertainment businesses\".\\nSales of UK games hit Â£2.96bn last year - more than from either video or music.\\nUkie carried out extensive consultations between September and February and found the main concern about Brexit for companies was losing access to skilled workers, with more than 57% saying they employed staff from the European Union.\\nSome 98% of respondents said EU nationals with the right skills should have a \"blanket right\" to both live and work in the UK in the future.\\n\"In very competitive, innovative global industries, like games, if UK businesses cannot attract the diverse talent they want and need, some firms are likely to relocate, taking jobs and economic opportunities with them,\" Ukie said.\\nOthers said divergences with EU laws around data could also pose a risk after Brexit.\\nA total of 63% said the cost of separating the data they hold on UK customers could impose \"significant costs\", with one firm saying it may stop publishing games in the UK as a result.\\nThere were also concerns that Brexit could leave UK companies unable to access funding from EU programmes such as Creative Europe - although Ukie said Brexit also offered an opportunity to improve public subsidies for the industry.\\nMore than 60% of games companies forecast growth in their businesses this year, down from 80% in 2016.</td>\n",
